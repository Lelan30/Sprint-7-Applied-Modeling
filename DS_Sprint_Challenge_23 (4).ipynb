In other words, this model should be able to predict whether an establishment will fail inspection *before* the inspector arrives at the establishment. \n","\n","# Directions\n","\n","This notebook contains 12 tasks, which cover the material we've learned in this sprint.

Delete the `raise NotImplementedError` before your start.\n","- Run the testing cell below the task.
